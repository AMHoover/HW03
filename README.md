# HW03
## Assignment
Read in some data and graph something in R

### Is that it?
Yep. 

### Uhhh...? Anything?
Yes, but I do have several notes and tips about this assignment:  

The idea for this assignment is to use the skills you learned in importing data into R (base read functions or readr functions) and to do some data visualization with that data. You are free to make any graph(s) (ideally more than one if the graphs you are making are simple to make or one that involves some extra formatting or extra spectial *pizazz*). A good idea might be to graph some data from lab that you previously graphed in Excel or using Graphpad/Prism. This would require putting the data in the repository, reading in the data, and creating a graph. Your code should have both reading in data and graphing, but otherwise you are free to make this about anything you want.  

Note #1: We haven't yet hit the data wrangling/manipulation section, so do be mindful that the data you import should be formatted reasonably so you can graph it. We haven't gotten to it, but formatting is 80% of coding so if you pick a completely random dataset, it most likely will not be formatted in a way that will be compatible with ggplot. You can try to fix it in R if you are up to the challenge or you can do it in excel. That isn't the part I'm interested in you practicing this week.

Note #2: you can choose to code using an R script or R markdown. If you want to knit the R markdown to make a markdown document github can read, create a new R markdown and choose any option (html will be the simplest) but change the output in the yaml header from "html_document" to be github_document (no quotes, see HW02 for an example). 

Note #3, remember that there is a file size limit of 100 MB. Don't commit a file that large! You **will** regret it. 

Note #4, remember to edit this Readme file and explain what you are doing!

Note #5, if you are trying to update or remake a graph you have previously made, it would be a good idea to include that image in the repository

#### What if need some ideas?
Idea #1: Remake a figure from your own, a lab's, or any publication where you can get your hands on the data

Idea #2: There are a ton of statistics on COVID cases and the increase over time. Try remaking one of those? You can even use [NY Times's Github Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

Idea #3: Gapminder is a common dataset for students to explore [here](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). It has data on countries. E.g. wealth, child mortality, access to electricity, etc. and the data may suprise you. They even made a [TED talk about it](https://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/)

Idea #4: Explore [some census data](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets.html) or some data from the NIH.
